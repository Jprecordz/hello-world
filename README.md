# hello-world
This is my first Github project 
I have always had an interest in coding. However, due to family life, work, and a bunch of other excuses I never got around to actually learning coding well. I always started but somehow stopped midway. Well fast forward a few year's, I've been working in public accounting and realize it's not the career I want and after being fired I figured what better time to learn to code than now.
